MyGitHub Profile page:

This is a mock page of my original github profile. The goal of this project was to make it idetical anf pixel perfect. It used the forEach function to pull in  the live information for the GitHub Api.

The problem that I am having is that my icons are not showing up.


How to use it:
bower install octicons

The Libaries I used were:
jQuery, Underscore
